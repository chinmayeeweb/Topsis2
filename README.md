To implement a solution for text sentence similarity using TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), you can follow these steps:

Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, removing stopwords, punctuation, and stemming/lemmatization.
Vectorization: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings.
Similarity Calculation: Compute the similarity between pairs of sentences using cosine similarity or another similarity metric.
TOPSIS: Apply the TOPSIS algorithm to rank the sentences based on their similarity scores.
Visualization: Visualize the results using a graph or other suitable visualization techniques.
